Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project 1
To execute the script run_analysis.R simply set your working directory to where this script is and execute source("run_analysis.R")
The script will save two files to the output: firstDataSet.txt and secondDataSet.txt
These files are tables and need to be read with read.table("firstDataSet.txt") for analysis
Please refer to the CodeBook.md file for descriptions of the data in each object
